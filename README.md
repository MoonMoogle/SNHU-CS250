Software Development Lifecycle

Final Project - Sprint Review & Retrospective Document
- Kayla Hood

  
    How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
   > I'd suggest it is best not to make interpretations when possible, nor guesses, but to ask questions and clarify either with the client, product owner, or whoever else may be in charge of working with the end users to determine requirements.
>
> User stories are an organization method for cataloguing client requirments and desires for the product they are commissioning. The user stories provide a structured layout for etablishing the 'what' and 'how' of each functionality - 'what' the functionality is intended to do, and 'how' it's intended to be accomplished. 
They also take into consideration the perceived difficulty, or effort level, of each requirement so that the development team(s) have an estimation of the work to be done while planning their sprint, as well as how each user story fits into the product backlog.
  
    How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

  > How do I *personally* approach developing a program? Honestly, I just start writing. Even though it *will* be wrong.
I just start doing what I think is close, to get some kind of foundation down. Then from there I see what errors are thrown back, and I start fixing the ones I understand easiest. From there other problems often become clear, or rectify themselves. If not I take to research for how to fix the problem, or approach the code.
I know it is frowned upon, but I don't particularly like the "write a few lines, test; write a few lines, test" method.
Which goes completely against Agile hah. But also this works for me because I am generally not making big programs, and in the textbook coding programs, often nothing would run, or even produce anything at all, even errors, if you did not have some kind of full program layout - just having a few lines of code produced nothing, even if you knew it should do something.
Very frustrating stuff. So out of frustration, I started operating this way.

> I suppose it would be beneficial to learn how to code and test as I go, as is often the case, than to go, go, go, and try to ammend a bunch of errors later.
  
    What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

  > Being a good team member requires good communication skills, the ability *to* communicate, accountability for mistakes, willingness to ask for help as well as helping others, asking questions when necessarry, and being cooperative.
But these are not all specific to software development. These are all important qualities to have on any team, regardless of positiion or the work being done.
